            <section>
              <p>
                Your privacy is important to Omny IQ. So we’ve developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we
                collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information. It applies to our products and
                technology that may be provided with a third party device or service that you have. Please take
                a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and let us know if you have any
                questions.

              <h2>WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE DO</h2>
              <p>
                Omny IQ’s mission is to provide a flawless connected experience to users. Every local network
                may have a variety of unique characteristics that affects the performance of your device. It’s often
                difficult for individual devices to work well in a network environment when they don’t have access
                to certain information on what’s going on around them. Because this device manufacturer cares
                about delivering the best user experience to you, as part of that commitment they’ve included
                Omny IQ software in the product that you purchased.
              </p>
              <div>
                Omny IQ makes it easier for the companies that design and manufacturer products to remotely
                troubleshoot and fix your device and potentially improve its performance by providing real-time
                information to them regarding what’s happening within your device as well as the local area
                network environment that it’s living in.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    In order to do that, we may collect certain information from your connected devices in real
                    time and in the live conditions that it is running in.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    This software is specifically designed to provide certain, anonymized data to Omny IQ that
                    we can then collect, analyze, and provide information to the manufacturer of this device.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The intent of the data collection and analysis is to provide you with a better connected
                    experience by helping the device manufacturer better understand what is happening with
                    your device and the live network conditions surrounding it.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    That information may allow the manufacturer to identify and correct certain problems for you
                    even before you know they exist.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Omny IQ also enables them to remotely update your device.

              <h2>WE DON’T COLLECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
              <p>
                We consider “Personal Information” to include User name, street address, phone number, or
                email address. Omny IQ does not collect your Personal Information associated with the device
                (or any other device running on the local network).

              <h2>WE DON’T TRACK YOUR WEB SURFING</h2>
              <p>
                We don’t track or report on any specific web surfing statistics such as the web sites you visit,
                social networks you participate in, products you purchase, or the games that you enjoy. We
                don’t collect that because we don’t sell it to advertisers or anyone else.

              <h2>THE TYPE OF NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT</h2>
              <div>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Omny IQ regularly and automatically collects data in a form that does not, on its own, permit
                    direct association with any specific individual. We consider this “Non‑Personal Information”
                    or Anonymous Information.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The collected information includes, for example, the IP address and MAC address associated
                    with your device, your device type and model, other device identifiers, various quality
                    measures, error logs, hardware and software version numbers, Wi-Fi network strength, and
                    certain demographics such the country and city where the device is connected.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We also collect data such as CPU utilization and other usage statistics.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Omny IQ may be able to report the presence of other devices running on the local network.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Any or all of this information may be used by the device manufacturer to better identify and
                    understand things such as device performance issues, non-current firmware, or potential
                    network conflicts that they may use to improve things such as the reliability or performance
                    of the device.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Omny IQ may collect, use, transfer, and disclose Non‑Personal Information for any purpose.
                  </li>
                </ul>

              <h2>WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION</h2>
              <div>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The information is securely uploaded to our cloud-based servers, where certain analysis is applied.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We then give access to that information to the device manufacturer so that they may make
                    decisions or take action as they determine. For example, the information may help the device
                    manufacturer to better identify and fix issues associated with potential problems such as
                    excessive device reboots, crashes, or local network conflicts.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In some instances, anonymized device Non-Personal Information specific to the local network
                    may be shared with other Omny IQ-enabled third party device manufacturers that have
                    devices present on your local network to better help your devices work together to
                    potentially identify and solve problems. An example of this may be when an Omny IQ-
                    enabled streaming entertainment device on your network is experiencing excessive buffering
                    of a video. That device may request certain information (that it otherwise wouldn’t have
                    access to) from other Omny IQ-enabled devices on the local network to help it identify the
                    performance issue. In this example it may request information regarding the WIFI router
                    signal strength or channel conflicts from an Omny IQ-enabled WIFI router, which may help
                    the streaming entertainment device manufacturer better troubleshoot and fix the issue.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Finally, we may also share aggregated, Non-Personal, anonymized or statistical information
                    about you, including demographics data, with others for a variety of purposes, including for
                    the device manufacturer’s own uses, for example, for improving their products and services
                    for you, Omny IQ and others.
